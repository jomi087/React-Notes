- **Controlled Components (G)**
    - A **Controlled Component** is a form input element (like `<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) **whose value is controlled by React state** instead of the DOM.
    - In a **Controlled Component**, React fully controls the form element's behavior using **state and event handlers**.
    - **Scenario :-** Easy to Validate **,** Since React controls it, validation logic can be added easily.
    - **When to Use Controlled Components?**
        - **Best for forms with validation or dynamic behavior.**
        - **When you need to update the UI based on user input.**
        - **Example Use Cases:**
            - Login form with **validation** (e.g., email format check).
            - Search bar with **live suggestions**.
            - Real-time **character counter** in a text field.
