- **Uncontrolled Components (G)**
    - An **Uncontrolled Component** is a form input element **that manages its own state internally**, instead of relying on React state. React does **not** control the input value; instead, the **DOM handles it directly** using `ref`
    - In simple words
        - The `<input>` does **not** have a `value` controlled by React state.
        - Instead, **a `ref` (`useRef()`) is used to access the input's value from the DOM**.
        - The component does **not re-render** when the input value changes.
        - **When to Use Uncontrolled Components?**
            - **Best when you need direct access to the DOM without triggering re-renders.**
            - **Useful for integrating non-React libraries** (e.g., working with third-party forms).
            - **When you don’t need to update the input value frequently in React state.**
            - **Example Use Cases:**
                - **File uploads** (`<input type="file" />`) – Since React cannot control file inputs.
                - **Forms with default values** that don’t change often.
                - **Handling focus or animations** (e.g., grabbing focus when a page loads)
